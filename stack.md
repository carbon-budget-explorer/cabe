# Stack

First prototype should be able to:

- Make a chloropleth map of countries coloured by some input data read from a file
- When you click a country, it should display more info, including
- A line chart showing data over time for the given country

Requirements:

- Hosted on Azure
- Easy to add new data (by scientists)
- Easy to change text content (some sort of markdown cms)

## Meta Framework + component framework

- **sveltekit + svelte**
  - Very fast / compiled / true reactivity
- nuxt + vue
  - Easy to learn
- nextjs + react
  - Stable
- remix + react
  - Fuzzy mix of server/client side rendering
- qwik
  - Uses their own components?
  - Up and coming
- ~astro~ + solidjs / react / vue / svelte
  - Astro focused on content rich websites, less on web applications
- ~solidstart~ + solidjs
  - Solidjs looks nice, but solidstart still in beta
