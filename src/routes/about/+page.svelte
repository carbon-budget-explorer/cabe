			<h2 class="text-2xl">Effort sharing principles</h2>

			<p>
				There are many different principles that can be used to divide up the global carbon budget
				between countries and regions.

			<h3 id="GF" class="text-xl"><a href="#GF">Grandfathering</a></h3>

			<p>
				Grandfathering is the principle that countries should be allowed to emit in the future in
				proportion to their historical emissions. This principle is often used to argue that
				developed countries should have higher emissions than developing countries.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="pb-4">
			<h3 id="PC" class="text-xl"><a href="#PC">Per capita</a></h3>

			<p>
				The per capita principle is the idea that each person should have an equal right to emit
				greenhouse gases. This principle is often used to argue that developed countries should have
				lower emissions than developing countries.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="pb-4">
			<h3 id="PCC" class="text-xl"><a href="#PCC">Per capita convergence</a></h3>

			<p>
				The per capita convergence principle is the idea that each person should have an equal right
				to emit greenhouse gases, and that countries should converge to equal per capita emissions
				over time. This principle is often used to argue that developed countries should have lower
				emissions than developing countries, but that developing countries should also reduce their
				emissions over time.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="pb-4">
			<h3 id="AP" class="text-xl"><a href="#AP">Ability to pay</a></h3>

			<p>
				The ability to pay principle is the idea that countries should be allowed to emit in
				proportion to their ability to pay for mitigation. This principle is often used to argue
				that developed countries should have higher emissions than developing countries.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="pb-4">
			<h3 id="GDR" class="text-xl"><a href="#GDR">Greenhouse development rights</a></h3>

			<p>
				The greenhouse development rights principle is the idea that each person should have an
				equal right to emit greenhouse gases, and that countries should converge to equal per capita
				emissions over time. This principle is often used to argue that developed countries should
				have lower emissions than developing countries, but that developing countries should also
				reduce their emissions over time.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="pb-4">
			<h3 id="ECPC" class="text-xl"><a href="#ECPC">Equal cumulative per capita</a></h3>

			<p>
				The equal cumulative per capita principle is the idea that each person should have an equal
				right to emit greenhouse gases, and that countries should converge to equal cumulative per
				capita emissions over time. This principle is often used to argue that developed countries
				should have lower emissions than developing countries, but that developing countries should
				also reduce their emissions over time.
